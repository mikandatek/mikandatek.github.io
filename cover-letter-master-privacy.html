    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 21, 2025</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Cover Letter Master</strong> is a one-time purchase, offline mobile application.
      Your privacy is extremely important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how your information
      is handled when you use the app.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
    <p>
      Cover Letter Master <strong>does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data</strong>.
      All information you enter (such as your name, job title, addresses, letter content, and signature)
      remains entirely on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Offline Usage</h2>
    <p>
      The app works fully offline. No internet connection is required to generate, preview,
      edit, sign, export, or share cover letters.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Any files you save (such as PDF cover letters or signature images) are stored locally on your device
      and are fully under your control. The app does not access or manage your files beyond
      what is required to save or share them at your request.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      The app may request limited permissions solely to enable core functionality:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>File access — to save PDF documents to your device</li>
      <li>Temporary storage — to share PDFs using other apps</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These permissions are used only when you explicitly perform related actions and are never used
      to collect or transmit data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. No Ads or Tracking</h2>
    <p>
      Cover Letter Master contains <strong>no advertisements</strong>,
      <strong>no analytics</strong>, and <strong>no tracking technologies</strong>.
      We do not use cookies, tracking SDKs, or third-party analytics services.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The app does not integrate with any external servers or cloud services.
      PDF viewing, sharing, and file saving rely only on system-level services provided by
      your operating system.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Cover Letter Master does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone,
      including children under the age of 13.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected
      on this page with an updated effective date.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via
      the official support channel listed on the app’s store page.
