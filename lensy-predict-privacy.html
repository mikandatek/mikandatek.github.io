<p>This data is collected via Google AdMob and Firebase services and is used solely to improve app performance and deliver relevant advertisements.</p>

<h3>b. Personal Information</h3>
<p>Lensy Predict does <strong>not</strong> require users to create accounts or submit personal information.</p>

<p>Administrator access uses Google Sign-In for authentication purposes only. This is limited to authorized administrators and is not available to general users.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Advertising</h2>
<p>Lensy Predict displays advertisements using Google AdMob.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ads help support free access to the app</li>

<h2>3. Consent Management</h2>
<p>Upon first launch, users are shown an ads disclosure and consent request where applicable.</p>

<p>You can manage or update your consent choices at any time through the app’s settings.</p>

<hr>

<h2>4. Firebase Services</h2>
<p>We use Firebase Firestore to store and retrieve app content such as match predictions.</p>

<p>Firebase may collect anonymized usage data in accordance with its own privacy policy.</p>
